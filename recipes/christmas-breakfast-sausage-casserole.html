        <h2>How to Make Breakfast Sausage Casserole</h2>
        <p>
            The full, simple recipe can be found below — but here's a peek into what you can expect when making this breakfast sausage casserole:

Brown the sausage and drain the excess grease. In a bowl, combine the mustard powder, egg, salt, and milk. Then add the cooked sausage, bread, and cheese. Pour into a baking dish and store covered in the refrigerator overnight (or at least 8 hours). Bake until eggs are set and the casserole is warmed through.

        <h2>How Long to Cook Breakfast Sausage Casserole</h2>
        <P>
            We recommend following this recipe's bake time. You'll first bake the covered casserole for 45 to 60 minutes. Then, uncover it, reduce the temperature, and continue cooking until the casserole is warmed through and the eggs are set, about 30 minutes.
        </P>

        <h2>What to Serve With Breakfast Sausage Casserole</h2>
        <p>
            This breakfast sausage casserole is pretty filling on its own, so you don't need to worry about any sides. But, if you like having extra options at your table, then you can serve it alongside a light side, like fresh fruit or yogurt.

        <h2>How to Store Breakfast Sausage Casserole</h2>
        <p>
            Store any leftovers in the fridge for up to five days. Reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.

        <h2>How to Freeze Breakfast Sausage Casserole</h2>
        <p>
            This casserole is a great freezer meal. Wrap the baked casserole (dish and all) in a layer of storage wrap then a layer of aluminum foil. You may want to use a disposable casserole dish for easy freezing — or freeze the casserole in individual portions in zip-top freezer bags.

Freeze for up to three months. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then bake in the oven until warmed through.
